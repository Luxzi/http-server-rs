# http-server-rs

A simple HTTP server in Rust; very minimal.

## Why?

I spent a week writing an HTTP server for two main reasons:

- For fun
- To prove I could do it

This HTTP was without any helper libraries, except some error handling and logging ones of course.

## Building

Development build:<br/>
`cargo build`

Release build:<br/>
`cargo build --release`
